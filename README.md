# H1 WEBSITE FOR A BAND
___
This five page frontend web application was developed as part completion of the 
Code Institute Full Stack Developer course. It is the milestone project for the 
User Centric Frontend Development stream. The application attempts to follow the
project brief and requirements. It presents a sample online presence for a 1960's
style rock band. It showcases the band's history, upcoming events/gigs, songs, 
video and a contact form.


# H2 UX
___
1. The application has attempted to meet all the requirements laid out in the 
assignment outline and design brief. No additional features were added outside of
the design brief.
2. The developer decided to use the resources provided in the GitHUb repo located at 
https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets
This decision was made to save time researching similar resources.
3. The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the fun 1960's psychedelic style and vibe
that was associated with the original "The Monkees" band.
4. The structure of the header and footer elements for the project was heavily 
influenced by the header developed in the "Putting It All Together | Mini Project" 
module of the User Centric Frontend Development stream.
5. The structure of the image gallery used in index.html was heavily influenced 
by a design portrayed by w3schools.com located at 
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
6. The structure of the mp3 track player used in sounds.html was heavily influenced
by a design portrayed by w3schools.com located at 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp
7. The structure of the contact form element used in contact.html was influenced
by same design used in the "Putting It All Together | Mini Project" module of the
User Centric Frontend Development stream.

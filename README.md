# WEBSITE FOR A BAND
This five page frontend web application was developed as part completion of the 
Code Institute Full Stack Developer course. It is the milestone project for the 
User Centric Frontend Development stream. The application attempts to follow the
project brief and requirements. It presents a sample online presence for a 1960's
style rock band. It showcases the band's history, upcoming events/gigs, photos, songs, 
video and a contact form.

## DEMO
* A live demo hosted on Heroku can be found ["here"](link)

## UX
1. The application has attempted to meet all the requirements laid out in the 
assignment outline and design brief. No additional features were added outside of
the design brief.
2. The developer decided to use the resources provided in the directed GitHub Repository 
in the assignment outline. This decision was made to save time researching similar resources.
3. The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the fun 1960's psychedelic style and vibe
that was associated with the original "The Monkees" band.
4. The structure of the header and footer elements for the project was heavily 
influenced by the header developed in the "Putting It All Together | Mini Project" 
module of the User Centric Frontend Development stream.
5. The structure of the contact form element used in contact.html was influenced
by same design used in the "Putting It All Together | Mini Project" module of the
User Centric Frontend Development stream.

## GitHub Repository 
[GitHUb repository for the project](https://github.com/KikiDow/User-centric-project)

## Features
* **Navigation Bar:** The application contains a navigation bar that allows the user to 
navigate through the site from any page on the site. The developer decided to use 
1960s' slang terms to label each page/section of the site. A "hover" animation is used#
to highlight the selected option.
* **SideBar:** The application contains a sidebar that outlines the bands upcoming live
performances.
* **Footer:** The application contains a footer that provides basic information on the band
and provides links to the bands fictitious facebook, twitter and instagram accounts using 
fontawesome icons.
* The index.html file/page contains **photographs of the band**, which upon clicked, open a separate
browser tab to show a larger version of the same image.
* The sounds.html file/page contains **embedded mp3 music files** so that the user can listen to a
a selection of the bands songs.
* The flicks.html file/page contains one **embedded mp4 video file** so that the user can see the band
perform.
* The contact.html file/page contains a **contact form** that would allow the user to send messages or
or requests to the band.

## Features To Implement
* An ecommerce feature/app to allow users buy tickets for upcoming concerts. This feature could also be used to allow the band sell merchandise to it's fans.
* A blog feature to allow both fans and members of the band share stories, articles, etc. This feature could also allow fans to comment and upvote on 
other contributions.
* I would like to have made the "Upcoming Gigs" section more dynamic, interactive or visually appealing using either a carousel or collapsible feature.

## Testing
* As no module for testing has yet been covered on the course, no technical tests were 
conducted on the application.
* A form of White Box testing was conducted by the developer using potential use cases or
user stories to ensure that each link in the application followed the intended path. This
was also done for each feature outlined in the Features section to ensure they were working 
as intended.
* A form of Black Box testing was done by asking both a friend and the student's mentor
on the course to use the application without instruction. Their feedback was then used 
to make improvements.

## Deployment
This project is deployed using GitHub pages. It was deployed as follows:
1. In the GitHub repository of the project, select the settings menu. 
2. Scroll down to the gh-pahes section.
3. From the source option, select the "Master Branch" and "save". For an app to deploy successfully on gh pages, the home page must be titled "index.html".
